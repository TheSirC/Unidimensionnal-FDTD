# Modeling 1D propagation of a pulse in material 
![Animation](https://github.com/TheSirC/Unidimensionnal-FDTD/blob/master/animation.gif)
Example of a pulse interaction mith a metallic interface

## Programming
### Intuition of the program
The program use Yee grids to compute a finite difference of the Maxwell equations

## Details
For further details on the implementation, please refer to the [code](https://github.com/TheSirC/Unidimensionnal-FDTD/tree/master/FDTD_1D.m) which is commented extensively.
